## Overview

Sky Engine AI is a robust synthetic data generation pipeline designed for computer vision applications. It generates high-quality synthetic 3D scenes with automatic annotations and AI-powered postprocessing, ready for machine learning pipelines.

## Features

- ÌøóÔ∏è **3D Scene Generation**: Create diverse synthetic scenes with configurable geometries, textures, and animations
- Ìø∑Ô∏è **Automatic Annotation**: Generate accurate annotations (bounding boxes, labels) for all synthetic objects
- Ì∑† **AI Postprocessing**: Extract meaningful features using neural networks
- Ì¥Ñ **Pipeline Integration**: Seamless integration with ML training workflows
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Fully Configurable**: Control all parameters via YAML configuration files
